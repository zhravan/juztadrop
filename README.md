- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Backend: Elysia
- Database: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Monorepo: Bun workspaces

## Prerequisites

- Bun >= 1.0 (install from <https://bun.sh>)
- Docker (for PostgreSQL)

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
make install
# or: bun install
```

Setup PostgreSQL (Docker):

```bash
make db-setup
```

Copy environment files:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
```

Generate and run migrations:

```bash
make db-generate
make db-migrate
```

Build packages (required before first run):

```bash
bun run build:packages
```

## Development

Start both frontend and backend:

```bash
make dev
```

Or individually:

```bash
bun run dev:web    # Frontend on :3000
bun run dev:api    # Backend on :3001
```

Database studio:

```bash
make db-studio
```

## Authentication

The platform has three user types:

- Volunteers: Auto-approved on registration
- Organizations: Require admin approval before posting opportunities
- Admins: Can approve/reject/blacklist organizations

Create the first admin user:

```bash
make db-seed-admin
# Default: admin@justadrop.xyz / admin123456
```

Override default admin credentials:

```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword ADMIN_NAME="Your Name" make db-seed-admin
```

## Email Notifications

The platform uses Resend for sending email notifications.

Setup email service:

1. Sign up for a free account at <https://resend.com>
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

Note: Email sending will be skipped in development if RESEND_API_KEY is not configured.

## Build

```bash
make build
```

## Database

Stop PostgreSQL:

```bash
make db-stop
```

Remove PostgreSQL container:

```bash
make db-remove
```
